# Hybrid API Architecture: Combining REST and GraphQL

The rise of API development has led us to identify different building blocks required to create a robust API. REST, standing for Representational State Transfer, and GraphQL, are two popular API building blocks. Both of these architectures, however, come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. To make the best use of both these systems, the current trend is to adopt a hybrid API architecture that combines the best of both worlds.

## Benefits of REST Over GraphQL

REST APIs have been around for longer than GraphQL and have established themselves as a popular industry-standard. It has been designed in such a way that it can work well for any type of application, from web to mobile. It follows a client-server model, where the server provides a set of endpoints that the client can use to request and receive data using HTTP requests.

In terms of scalability, REST APIs can handle very large data sets efficiently. They also work with a wider range of tools, platforms and programming languages. REST’s versatility means that it can be easily integrated with third-party systems such as payment processors or authentication providers. 

Another advantage of REST API is that it utilizes a user-friendly interface. URIs combined with HTTP verbs (CRUD operations) provides an intuitive way of interacting with data. This makes it a good choice for certain use-cases, such as mobile applications where quick data transactions are essential. 

## Benefits of GraphQL Over REST

GraphQL, on the other hand, is a newcomer to the API scene. It is a query language for APIs that makes it easier to access multiple resources with a single API call. Instead of having multiple endpoints, as REST does, GraphQL has only one endpoint that can retrieve all the related data within a single request. Queries and arguments can be formed in a single request, which makes application development much more efficient.

If REST APIs utilize a functional interface, GraphQL APIs have a more object-oriented interface. It works well in applications where you want to have more control over the data that is returned. It allows the application to define the shape of the data it wants to receive, returning only the relevant data while reducing the amount of overhead needed to manipulate it. 

For example, on a mobile app, you may want to render a list of products with their names, prices, and images. Using GraphQL, you can define a query that will extract only the data that you need, i.e., the name, price, and image. In contrast, with REST, you would need to make multiple API calls, one for each product.

## Combining REST and GraphQL

Hybrid architecture is based on combining the strengths of both architectures. REST, with its wide adoption and versatility, remains a popular choice for serving static resources, where objects are not changed frequently, i.e., images, videos or documentation. 

Meanwhile, GraphQL is used for dynamic data, where objects are more likely to change frequently. Using GraphQL on a hybrid architecture allows us to send queries specifically designed to retrieve only the data we want. In effect, GraphQL acts as a middleware between the client application and the REST API where HTTP requests are routed through it allowing GraphQL to control which resources are being called by the client.

By combining the strengths of REST and GraphQL, a hybrid architecture promotes a unified API that enhances application development, makes development the process much more streamlined, enables easy additions of features and functionalities, and allows for faster execution of queries.

## When Should You Use Hybrid Architecture?

Hybrid architecture intends to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of both REST and GraphQL, and combining the benefits of both. While hybrid architecture is great, there are times when REST or GraphQL is a better fit than Hybrid. 

If the use case involves a significant number of static resources, REST performs best. Some examples of resources are product images, logos, and videos. If your API has endpoints for retrieving data such as these, it’s best to stick with a REST API.

On the other hand, if the use case involves making many requests to different endpoints for obtaining data that can be aggregated, GraphQL is better positioned. When queries and data formats change frequently, and flexibility is a must in client-server communication, GraphQL is a preferable choice.

Lastly, if you want to utilize both REST and GraphQL, you should have a clear idea of what is expected in the API design. Hybrid architecture combines the strengths of both architectures, and, while it is generally preferred, careful analysis of use-cases and data requirements may conclude that one of the two architectures is better suited for your application or API.

## Conclusion

In the end, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to API design. REST and GraphQL are architected differently. Each has its own advantages and limitations. Deploying them independently or in a Hybrid architecture depends mainly on the goal and needs of the project, the preferences of developers, the nature of the data, and the end-user requirements.

By combining the two architectures into a hybrid architecture, there are many benefits to gain, including agile application development, efficient client communication, and scalability on resources for dynamic applications. Adopting a hybrid API approach allows for immediate solutions and flexible applications that have the potential to integrate more effectively with the current and future architectures.
