# API Orchestration: A Primer on Choreography and Orchestration

API orchestration is a vital aspect of modern software development, one that enables efficient and seamless communication between various software components. This communication forms the basis of successful distributed computing, enabling the creation of powerful solutions that span across different systems and platforms.

API orchestration is a broad term that encompasses many concepts, including choreography and orchestration. While both approaches can be used to connect APIs, they are implemented very differently. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at choreography versus orchestration in API orchestration, and explore the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

## Choreography: A Bottom-Up Approach

One approach to API orchestration is choreography. In this approach, each API component is programmed to monitor incoming messages from other API components. Each API component is responsible for determining what to do next based on the contents of the incoming message. This decentralized approach is similar to a dance where each dancer is responsible for their moves and responds to the moves of other dancers. In the context of APIs, choreography requires each component to be autonomous and able to react to the events happening around them.

The benefit of choreography is that it’s a scalable solution that doesn’t require a central point of control. Because each component sends and receives messages independently, the system can adapt to changing conditions, even as new services or components are added. This makes choreography a popular choice for large-scale distributed solutions, especially those deployed across cloud infrastructure.

However, the disadvantage of choreography is that it can be difficult to visualize what’s happening in the system. Changes made to one API component can have a ripple effect on the other components, and without a centralized view of the system, it can be challenging to track down the root cause of a problem.

## Orchestration: A Top-Down Approach

Another approach to API orchestration is orchestration. In this approach, a central controller is responsible for managing each API component’s actions. The controller is aware of the dependencies between each component and can determine the appropriate response to each message received. In the context of APIs, orchestration is more like a symphony, where a conductor manages the instruments of the orchestra to produce a harmonious overall sound.

The benefit of orchestration is that it provides a centralized view of the entire system, which makes it easier to manage and maintain. You can quickly determine the root cause of any issues and implement corrective measures accordingly. Additionally, by centralizing control, orchestration can enable you to implement cross-component policies, such as authentication or rate limiting, and apply it across the entire system.

However, the disadvantage of orchestration is that it can be challenging to scale up to very large systems. The central controller can become a bottleneck if it’s not properly designed, or if the system is under heavy load. Moreover, because orchestration is more tightly coupled, changes can be slower and more difficult to implement.

## Combining Choreography and Orchestration

So what’s the best approach to API orchestration: choreography or orchestration? The answer is that it depends. There are use cases for both approaches, and in some instances, a hybrid approach that combines the two can be the best solution.

For example, you may choose to use an orchestration layer to oversee core services like authentication or rate limiting, while using choreography for less critical components that need to be highly scalable. Or, you may choose to use choreography but have a centralized logging system that pulls data from all components, providing a centralized view of the system.

## Conclusion

API orchestration is an essential ingredient for distributed computing, enabling modular software solutions to communicate with each other seamlessly. While both choreography and orchestration can be used to connect APIs, they have different strengths and weaknesses. Both approaches can be highly effective when used in the right context. However, by combining the two approaches, you can create a highly scalable and maintainable API orchestration solution that can meet the needs of even the most complex distributed systems.
