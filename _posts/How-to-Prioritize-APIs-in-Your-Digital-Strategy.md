# How to Prioritize APIs in Your Digital Strategy 

In today's digital world, APIs play a critical role in enabling organizations to create new business models, achieve operational efficiency, and deliver exceptional customer experiences. But with the plethora of APIs available in the market, it's often challenging for companies to determine which APIs to prioritize in their digital strategy. In this blog post, we will discuss how to prioritize APIs in your digital strategy.

## Define your business objectives

Before considering which APIs to prioritize, it's crucial to define your business objectives. When you have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve, it would be easier to identify which APIs align with your objectives. For instance, if your goal is to enhance customer experience, you might consider prioritizing APIs that enable real-time communication or provide personalized insights.

## Assess your IT capabilities 

It's essential to assess your organization's IT capabilities before making API selection decisions. Evaluate your infrastructure and determine if it can support the APIs that you have shortlisted. Ensure that you have the necessary resources to implement and maintain the APIs effectively. Consider the level of expertise you have in-house versus what will need to be outsourced. This can help you decide which APIs to prioritize.

## Identify APIs that align with your business processes 

APIs should complement your existing business processes. Therefore, it's advisable to prioritize APIs that align with your existing workflows. Consider how your business processes operate and determine which APIs can integrate into those processes to enhance efficiency. Look for APIs that provide the features and functionalities required by your company's operations.

## Evaluate API functionality 

It's essential to evaluate the functionality offered by different APIs. Consider the API's capabilities holistically, including features such as ease of integration, scalability and customization capabilities. Evaluate if the API provides the functionality required to achieve your business objectives. Assess if the API has the necessary security features to ensure data protection.

## Assess the API vendor

It's essential to assess the API vendor before integrating their API into your digital strategy. Look for vendors who have a good reputation in the industry and a demonstrated track record of delivering high-quality APIs. Evaluate their support services and level of responsiveness in case of service issues. Choose vendors that align with your organization values such as data privacy and security.

## Consider the cost and ROI of APIs 

APIs come with a cost, and it's essential to evaluate if the cost is justified. Look for APIs that provide value for money and have a reasonable return on investment (ROI). Determine if the ROI aligns with your business objectives. Consider the short-term and long-term impact on your organization's cost and ROI.

## Prioritize APIs based on Impact

Consider the impact that an API would have on your organization. Prioritize APIs that have a high impact on your business objectives. Identify APIs that provide significant benefits to your organization, such as cost savings or revenue generation. Look for APIs that drive innovation and enhance your organization's competitiveness.

## Chose APIs that can adapt to changes

The digital world is continually evolving, and it's essential to choose APIs that can adapt to changes. Look for APIs that can easily integrate with new technologies and other APIs. Evaluate how the API can impact other components of your digital strategy. Prioritize APIs that are flexible and have customization capabilities.

## Involve different stakeholders

APIs have far-reaching effects on different stakeholders in your organization. It's crucial to involve the relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process. Involve IT teams, business leaders, and developers in the API selection process. This can help you get buy-in from all stakeholders, facilitate a smoother implementation process and enhance the chances of successful adoption.

## Monitor API performance

Once APIs have been integrated, it's essential to monitor their performance continually. Use analytics tools to track usage, identify issues, and optimize API performance. Monitor how the API is impacting your digital strategy and evaluate if the selected APIs are delivering the desired results. Use performance metrics to determine the ROI of the API and ensure continuous improvement.

In conclusion, APIs play a crucial role in today's digital landscape, and it's essential to prioritize them in your digital strategy. Define your business objectives, assess your IT capabilities, evaluate API functionality, assess the API vendor, consider the cost and ROI of APIs, prioritize APIs based on impact, choose APIs that can adapt to changes, involve different stakeholders and monitor API performance. By following these steps, you can prioritize the right APIs to achieve your digital objectives, enhance efficiency and drive innovation.
