# API Gateway vs. Traditional API Design

API Gateway and traditional API design models have been up for debate for some time now. API Gateway, which emerged as an alternative to traditional API design, has been gaining more popularity in recent times.

In this blogpost, we'll delve into the differences between these two models and why API Gateway is becoming the preferred choice for many developers.

## Traditional API Design

In traditional API design, you design and release an endpoint for each function or capability of an application. These endpoints are responsible for handling requests that are related to a particular function. You can imagine how this scales as an application grows.

Traditional API design has some benefits. It’s simple to develop and understand – especially for small applications. Also, it is easy to set up and monitor since each endpoint has a particular focus. However, it has its disadvantages.

In a nutshell:

- Each endpoint is responsible for a specific function.
- No centralized management of endpoints.
- Endpoints are only accessible via the internet.

## API Gateway

API Gateway, on the other hand, is a centralized management system for APIs. It employs a single entry point for all traffic in and out of the network. This approach is different from traditional API design because all traffic routes through a central gateway.

API Gateway provides developers with an interface to build and test endpoints. The entry point's primary goal is to direct the user to the appropriate endpoint so that they can access the desired function.

Here are some advantages of using API Gateway:

- The single gateway reduces communication latency.
- Centralized management of endpoints.
- Possibility for caching - this improves the performance of the gateway.
- Supports different protocols, such as REST and GraphQL.
- Allows easy integration with third-party services.

However, when it comes to designing an API gateway, it's vital to consider scalability – scaling the infrastructure can be a challenging task.

# When Should You Use API Gateway - And Why?

API Gateway is an excellent solution when you need centralized control and management of your API traffic. Here are some of the scenarios where you should consider using an API Gateway:

## Securing API Traffic

API Gateway can be used to secure traffic between the API gateway and clients. The applications can employ JSON web tokens (JWTs) to derivate authentication from authenticated devices securely. Also, SSL/TLS can be deployed to secure communication.

## Microservices Architecture

API Gateway is the centralized hub for requests between microservices, decoupling services, and making it easy to update or retire old services. It hides the inner workings of the microservices, which means that changes made to services do not affect the clients.

## Authentication and Authorization

API Gateway can be used for authentication and authorization. It becomes easier to manage user access, especially if some functions are only available to a limited number of users.

## Traffic Control

API Gateway provides a way to monitor, manage, and balance the network traffic flow. This makes it easy to scale up as the application demand grows.

## Aggregating Services

Applications often comprise several services, which can lead to complexity. API Gateway makes it easier to aggregate services because the clients do not know or care about the inner workings of the API Gateway.

# Conclusion

API Gateway and traditional API design models have their pros and cons. However, it's essential to consider the scalability of your application when choosing a model. API Gateway is becoming the preferred choice for many developers because of its numerous advantages, including centralized management of endpoints, the possibility of caching, easy integration with third-party services, and support for different protocols.

In summary, API Gateway is suitable for large applications that require centralized control of all traffic in and out of the application. However, traditional API design is suitable for smaller applications that do not need centralized management.
