# How to Secure API Architecture with OAuth 2.0

API (Application Programming Interface) is the cornerstone of software development, and over the last few years, it has become a powerful tool for businesses to leverage their assets, data and services. As APIs continue to play a central role in the development of digital products, the importance of ensuring their security has never been more crucial.

OAuth 2.0 is a powerful protocol designed to protect APIs against unauthorized access. In this blog, we’ll discuss how OAuth 2.0 provides secure API architecture and the steps that you can take to implement it within your own development environment.

## Overview of OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is a widely accepted protocol for secure authorization that is utilized by many APIs of popular internet platforms such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, and more. The protocol defines a standard set of rules and guidelines that provide secure access to an API, and its authorization framework is built around a system of Access Tokens, Refresh Tokens, and Scopes.

Access Tokens are short-lived tokens that are issued to an authenticated user, app or other third-party services, to make requests to the API. Tokens are obtained by exchanging user credentials or authentication tokens for a temporary authorization token. This temporary token is then used to access protected resources.

Refresh Tokens are long-lived tokens that are issued alongside the access token, and are used to obtain a new Access Token once the time limit of the previous Access Token has expired.

Scopes are defined sets of permissions that allow a specific user or application to access certain resources, specific functionalities, and data, depending on their level of permissions.

The OAuth 2.0 protocol is designed to work well with modern restful APIs, whose architecture often utilizes secure HTTPS protocol, and minimizes the need for the user or application to store sensitive information that could be compromised.

## Implementing OAuth 2.0 in your API

Implementing OAuth 2.0 within your API will provide it with the necessary levels of security to protect it against potential threats. Here are the steps you can take to integrate OAuth 2.0 into your API architecture:

### Step 1: Register your API with an OAuth Provider

OAuth 2.0 mandates that all requests from an API need to be authenticated by a third-party. The first step in implementing OAuth 2.0 into your API is to register your API with an OAuth Provider such as Google, Twitter, or Facebook.

By registering your API, you provide the OAuth Provider with information about your API, such as its name, its endpoints, and its endpoints’ permitted scopes.

### Step 2: Request Authorization from Users

Once you have registered your API with an OAuth Provider, you can begin to request authorization from users. This will allow you to authenticate requests from users through the OAuth provider.

To request authorization from users, you will need to provide a button or a link on your application that redirects them to the OAuth provider's authorization page. Once the user has granted authorization, the OAuth provider will redirect them back to your application.

### Step 3: Obtain an Access Token

Once the user has been authenticated by the OAuth provider, your application or API can then request an Access Token, which can be used to access protected resources.

To obtain an Access Token from the OAuth provider, your application will need to send a request to the OAuth provider with the user's Access Token and the scope of authorization you have requested.

The OAuth provider will then validate the user's Access Token and return an Access Token with the requested scope. This token will be used to access the protected resource.

### Step 4: Securing the Access Token

Access Tokens must be secured, as they are critical when it comes to authenticating requests for secure resources. To secure the access token, you should use Secure Socket Layers (SSL),  which provide encryption between your API, the application, and the OAuth provider.

You should also ensure that the Access Token is stored securely in a database or server, as well as provide verification checks on the Access Token to prevent unauthorized access.

### Step 5: Implementing Scopes

Implementing Scopes in your API allows users to access specific data resources only, ensuring further security. Scopes define permissions that restrict the API access to user-specific data and functionalities.

Scopes also allow API developers to configure different access levels according to their needs. This means that the developer can allow access to read-only data, modify user resources, or allow administrative access to the developer team.

### Step 6: Use Refresh Tokens

Finally, it is best practice to use Refresh Tokens to keep an Access Token up to date after the lifespan of a token expires. Refresh Tokens are long-lived tokens, allowing a request for a new Access Token without requiring the user to re-authenticate themselves.

By default, a Refresh Token should last longer than an Access Token, which typically has a lifespan of fewer than 60 minutes.

## Conclusion

The popularity of APIs for exposing business logic and data to third-party applications has resulted in an increase in security vulnerabilities. Thus, the importance of ensuring secure access to APIs has never been more important.

In this article, we have discussed OAuth 2.0, a powerful protocol that is designed to provide secure authorization to APIs. We have provided six steps you can take to implement OAuth 2.0 security into your API architecture, including registering your API with an OAuth provider, requesting authorization from users, obtaining an Access Token, securing the Access Token, implementing Scopes, and using Refresh Tokens.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your API is protected against potential cyber threats, and provide users with a secure channel to access your platform's resources.
