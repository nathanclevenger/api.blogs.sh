# When to Use REST or SOAP APIs?

If you are a developer working with APIs, you have most likely encountered REST and SOAP APIs. Both API types have their own strengths and use cases. However, choosing the right API type can have significant impacts on the success of your project. In this blog post, we will dive into the key differences between REST and SOAP APIs and when to use each one.

## What is REST API?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and properties based on HTTP. REST API is built on the HTTP protocol and uses HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE to manipulate resources. REST APIs are lightweight and provide a high level of scalability and flexibility, making them the most popular API type.

### Advantages of REST API:

- Scalable and flexible: RESTful applications can handle high traffic loads and are easy to modify to meet changing needs.

- Stateless: REST APIs do not store client's session information, which makes them easy to scale.

- Lightweight: REST only requires JSON or XML to transmit data, making it more lightweight than SOAP.

- Widely adopted: REST is a widely adopted technology with many developers, companies, and tools supporting it.

- Request-response model: RESTful applications operate in a client-server model, where applications only need to interact with a few endpoints defined in the API.

### Disadvantages of REST API:

- No built-in security: REST APIs do not have a built-in security mechanism.

- Lack of standardization: REST does not have a formal standard, making it difficult to ensure API consistency and compatibility.

- Limited functionality: REST only supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for manipulating resources.

## What is SOAP API?

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol that uses XML to transmit data between systems. SOAP API relies on a set of well-defined rules and is designed to handle complex enterprise-level applications. SOAP is usually used in enterprise environments where security and reliability are essential.

### Advantages of SOAP API:

- Built-in security: SOAP has built-in security features and provides standardization for authentication and encryption.

- More functionality: SOAP supports more complex operations and provides features such as transactions and workflow control.

- Formal standard: SOAP has a formal standard, which makes it easier to ensure API consistency and compatibility.

- Well-defined error handling: SOAP has a more robust error handling mechanism that provides detailed error messages and enables automatic error detection.

### Disadvantages of SOAP API:

- Overhead: SOAP has a lot of overhead compared to REST, making it slower and less scalable.

- Complexity: SOAP APIs can be more complex than REST APIs, making it difficult to learn and integrate.

- Not widely adopted: SOAP is less widely adopted compared to REST, making it more difficult to find resources and libraries.


## When should you use REST API?

REST API is best suited for public, lightweight, and scalable applications that are designed to handle high traffic loads. REST API is a better fit in the following scenarios:

- Mobile applications: Since REST APIs are lightweight and operate on HTTP, they are well-suited for mobile applications that have limited resources.

- Web applications: REST APIs are a better choice for web applications that require scalability and flexibility.

- IoT applications: REST APIs can be used in IoT applications that require communication between devices and web servers.

- Public APIs: REST APIs are a good choice for public APIs that require lightweight communication protocols and are designed for a large number of users.

## When should you use SOAP API?

SOAP API is best suited for enterprise applications with complex functionality and a need for high-levels of security and reliability. SOAP API is a better fit in the following scenarios:

- Large-scale enterprise applications: SOAP APIs are more suited for large-scale enterprise applications with complex functionality and high levels of security and reliability.

- Transactions: SOAP APIs can handle complex operations such as transactions and support workflow control.

- Secure APIs: SOAP APIs are more secure than REST APIs and are designed for applications that require high levels of authentication and encryption.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right API type can have significant impacts on the success of your project. REST API is best suited for public, lightweight, and scalable applications that require flexibility and scalability. On the other hand, SOAP API is the better choice for enterprise applications with complex functionality and a need for high levels of security and reliability. Based on your project's requirements, you should choose the API type that best aligns with your goals.
