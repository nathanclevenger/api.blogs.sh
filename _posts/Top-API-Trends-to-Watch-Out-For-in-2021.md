# Top API Trends to Watch Out For in 2021

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have become a crucial part of modern software development. They enable different applications to interact and share data with each other, making it easier to build software applications. The use of APIs is on the rise, and it's expected to increase in the coming years. This article highlights some of the top API trends that developers should watch out for in 2021.

## 1. RESTful APIs

RESTful APIs have been around for a while, but they still dominate the market due to their benefits. They provide a simple and flexible architecture, making them easy to develop, maintain and scale. Most modern web applications use RESTful APIs due to their ease of use, reliability and speed. RESTful APIs are stateless and cacheable, making them ideal for managing large volumes of data.

## 2. GraphQL APIs

GraphQL is an open-source technology that addresses some of the limitations of RESTful APIs. With GraphQL APIs, developers can fetch only the data they need, rather than retrieving an entire dataset. This makes GraphQL APIs more efficient, faster and flexible than RESTful APIs. GraphQL APIs are highly scalable, enabling developers to add new features or make changes easily.

## 3. Microservices

Microservices are becoming more popular due to their ability to enable continuous deployment and integration. They allow developers to break down monolithic applications into small and independent services that can be easily deployed and maintained. Microservices enable developers to build, test and deploy each service independently, thereby improving agility and speed.

## 4. API Security

API security has become a top priority for developers due to the increasing threats and data breaches. Developers need to ensure that they implement robust security measures to protect API endpoints and data. Some of the best security measures include implementing transport layer security (TLS), using authentication and access controls, and encrypting data at rest and in transit.

## 5. Serverless APIs

Serverless computing has been gaining popularity, and it's expected to continue in 2021. With serverless APIs, developers can build, run and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure. Instead, cloud service providers manage the infrastructure, and developers only pay for the resources they use. Serverless APIs are highly scalable, cost-effective and require less maintenance.

## 6. Low-code APIs

Low-code APIs are a new trend that's been gaining traction in recent years. With low-code APIs, developers can build applications without coding from scratch. Low-code APIs provide a visual interface that enables developers to drag and drop components, build forms, and design workflows. This trend is expected to grow in 2021, as more developers look for ways to build applications faster and efficiently.

## 7. AI-powered APIs

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the software industry, and APIs are not an exception. AI-powered APIs enable developers to add intelligent features to their applications, such as machine learning, natural language processing and image recognition. With AI-powered APIs, developers can build intelligent applications that can learn and adapt to user needs, making them more intuitive and engaging.

## 8. Event-driven APIs

Event-driven APIs provide developers with a powerful way to build reactive and scalable applications. The architecture is based on events that trigger actions in another application or service. With event-driven APIs, developers can build applications that respond to real-time events, making them more flexible and dynamic. This trend is expected to grow in 2021, as more developers look for ways to build real-time applications.

## 9. Open APIs

Open APIs provide developers with an opportunity to build applications that can interact with third-party APIs. Open APIs enable developers to access data and features from other applications, providing more opportunities to build innovative applications. Open APIs are essential for building integrations between different applications, making it easier to build a connected and efficient ecosystem.

## 10. API Documentation

API documentation is often an overlooked aspect of API development. Good documentation is essential for developers to understand how to use an API and its features. It helps them to build applications faster and efficiently. In 2021, developers should focus on building good documentation for their APIs, making it easier for other developers to use their APIs.

In conclusion, APIs are an essential part of modern software development, and the trends discussed in this article are some of the top ones to watch out for in 2021. RESTful and GraphQL APIs remain dominant, but emerging trends such as serverless APIs, low-code APIs, and AI-powered APIs are likely to gain significant traction. Developers should also focus on building secure and well-documented APIs, ensuring that they can build faster, efficient and innovative applications.
